        <h1>CHET <br>
            BAKER</h1>
        <p>A jazz trumpet runner and singer in the United States. <br>
            Famous for his loose, romantic, and somewhat melancholy <br>
            -feeling trumpet performance and singing, as well as <br>
            his tremendous crazy life reversal. Master of West Coast <br>
            jazz and one of the legendary musicians representing Cool <br>
            jazz. His real name is Chesney Henry Baker, Jr. (Chesney <br>
            Henry Baker, Jr.) Born on December 23, 1929 and died on <br>
            May 13, 1988. <br>
            <br>
            All the young musician Chet Baker loved his music, but <br>
            only his lovers Jane and Trumpet remained beside him the <br>
            moment they could no longer play. There is music that I <br>
            want to play even if this is the last moment, and there <br>
            is a life I want to live. Again, in Chet Baker's own way.</p>
